### Task: Design a bird

1. Requirements
2. The Bird class currently violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) due to the presence of if-else statements.
3. Adding new functionality to the existing codebase would also violate the Open-Closed Principle (OCP).
4. Creating a separate class for new functionality may lead to a class explosion, which may not be desirable.
